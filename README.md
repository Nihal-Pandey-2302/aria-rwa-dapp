## üéØ The Problem & Our Solution

Tokenizing Real-World Assets (RWAs) is crippled by a fundamental bottleneck: **trust and liquidity**. Manual verification is slow, expensive, and fails to create truly tradable assets.

**A.R.I.A. (Automated RWA Intelligence & Authentication)** solves this by creating a trustless, fully automated pipeline from raw documents to liquid, AI-verified on-chain assets. We have built a complete, self-sustaining protocol with a fully on-chain business model, powered by the composability of Andromeda's Operating System (aOS).

Our "document-to-DeFi" lifecycle is live and fully automated:
1.  **AI-Powered Verification:** A custom AI Agent uses **Google Gemini** for deep data analysis and **QR Code Cross-Verification** to provide two-factor proof of authenticity.
2.  **On-Chain Integrity:** The AI's full verification report is formatted into rich metadata and permanently pinned to **IPFS**.
3.  **Composable aOS Workflow:** Our custom contract programmatically mints a "Verified RWA" NFT on a **CW721 ADO**, which is then listed on a **Marketplace ADO**.
4.  **Automated On-Chain Value Capture:** The Marketplace sends all sale proceeds to a **Splitter ADO**, routing a 5% platform fee directly to a **CW20 Staking ADO**.
5.  **Community-Owned Yield:** Holders of the native **$ARIA** token can stake their tokens to earn a proportional share of all platform revenue, creating a complete, decentralized economic loop.

## üó∫Ô∏è Architecture & aOS Composability

Our architecture is a seamless integration of off-chain AI processing with on-chain composable smart contracts. We successfully chained **`Custom Contract -> CW721 -> Marketplace -> Splitter -> Staking ADO`** to create a fully automated, on-chain business model.

This is made transparent to the user through our **Live Workflow Visualizer**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

We delivered a feature-rich MVP that showcases a truly investable and self-sustaining protocol.

* ‚úÖ **Complete Economic Loop:** An end-to-end, on-chain business model where platform fees from the **Marketplace** automatically fund the **Staking contract** via a **Splitter ADO**.
* ‚úÖ **Deep AI Integration:** Multi-factor verification using Gemini Vision and on-document QR code validation, presented in a polished "AI Report Card".
* ‚úÖ **Professional UX/UI:** A custom dark theme, a modern header with a wallet "chip", toast notifications, and component-based code create a premium user experience.
* ‚úÖ **Live Workflow Visualizer:** A dynamic visualizer that makes the complex backend process transparent and engaging.
* ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Dashboards:** Includes a "My RWA Portfolio" to view minted assets and a full-featured "Staking Dashboard" for yield management.
* ‚úÖ **"Payload Viewer" for Judges:** An integrated modal for technical reviewers to inspect the raw JSON transaction payloads, demonstrating our deep command of the aOS protocol.
