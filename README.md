## üéØ The Problem & Our Solution

Tokenizing Real-World Assets (RWAs) is crippled by a fundamental bottleneck: **trust and liquidity**. Manual verification is slow and expensive, and even tokenized assets have no native venue to be traded.

**A.R.I.A. (Automated RWA Intelligence & Authentication)** solves this by creating a trustless, end-to-end ecosystem. We have built a complete, self-sustaining protocol‚Äîpowered by Andromeda's aOS‚Äîthat handles the entire lifecycle of a Real-World Asset.

Our "document-to-DeFi" lifecycle is live and fully automated:

1. **AI-Powered Verification:** A custom AI Agent uses **Google Gemini** for deep data analysis and **QR Code Cross-Verification** to provide two-factor proof of authenticity.
2. **On-Chain Integrity:** The AI's full verification report is formatted into rich metadata and permanently pinned to **IPFS**.
3. **Mint & List:** Our custom contract programmatically mints a "Verified RWA" NFT on a **CW721 ADO** and the user can instantly list it on the integrated **Marketplace ADO**.
4. **Trade & Earn:** The Marketplace allows anyone to buy the RWA NFT. Proceeds are sent to a **Splitter ADO**, which routes a 5% platform fee to a **CW20 Staking ADO**.
5. **Community-Owned Yield:** Holders of the native **$ARIA** token can stake their tokens to earn a proportional share of all platform revenue, creating a complete, decentralized economic loop.

## üó∫Ô∏è Architecture & aOS Composability

Our architecture is a seamless integration of off-chain AI processing with on-chain composable smart contracts. We successfully chained **`Custom Contract -> CW721 -> Marketplace -> Splitter -> Staking ADO`** to create a fully automated, on-chain business model.

This is made transparent to the user through our **Live Workflow Visualizer**.
