## üéØ The Problem We Solved

Tokenizing Real-World Assets (RWAs) is the next frontier of DeFi, but it's crippled by a fundamental bottleneck: **trust and liquidity**. The current process is slow, requires expensive manual verification, and results in on-chain assets that are difficult to value and trade. A.R.I.A. attacks this problem head-on, creating a trustless, fully automated pipeline from any raw document to a liquid, AI-verified on-chain asset.

-----

## üí° Our Solution: The A.R.I.A. Protocol

We have successfully built a polished, full-stack dApp that showcases the true composability of Andromeda's Operating System (aOS) from end to end. A.R.I.A. is not just an application, but a complete, self-sustaining protocol with a fully on-chain business model.

**A.R.I.A. delivers a complete "document-to-DeFi" lifecycle:**

1. **AI-Powered Verification:** Our Python AI Agent uses **Google's Gemini API** for deep analysis and **QR Code Cross-Verification** to provide two-factor proof of a document's authenticity.
2. **On-Chain Integrity:** The AI's report is formatted into rich metadata, permanently pinned to **IPFS**, forming the bedrock of the RWA's on-chain value.
3. **Composable aOS Workflow:** Our custom contract programmatically mints a "Verified RWA" NFT on a **CW721 ADO**. The user then lists this NFT on a **Marketplace ADO**.
4. **Automated Value Capture:** The Marketplace is configured to send all sale proceeds to a **Splitter ADO**, which automatically routes a 5% platform fee directly to a **CW20 Staking ADO**.
5. **Community-Owned Value:** Holders of the **$ARIA** token can stake their tokens in our Staking Dashboard to earn a proportional share of all platform revenue, creating a complete, decentralized economic loop.

## üó∫Ô∏è Architecture & Workflow

Our architecture is a seamless integration of off-chain AI processing with on-chain composable smart contracts, made transparent to the user through our Live Workflow Visualizer.

-----

## ‚ú® Key Features & Why We Should Win

We delivered a feature-rich MVP that directly addresses and excels in every category of the judging criteria, presenting a truly investable solution.

#### Core Functionality & aOS Integration

* ‚úÖ **End-to-End RWA Tokenization:** A complete, working flow from document upload to a tradable NFT listed on a marketplace.
* ü§ñ **Deep AI Integration:** Google Gemini provides the core data and trust layer for each RWA.
* üß© **aOS Composability Masterclass:** We successfully chained **Custom Contract -\> CW721 -\> Marketplace -\> Splitter -\> Staking ADO** to create a fully automated, on-chain business model.
* üí∞ **Complete On-Chain Economic Loop:** We implemented a native token (`$ARIA`) and a staking contract. The integrated Splitter automatically funds the staking contract with platform fees from every sale, demonstrating a self-sustaining and investable protocol.

#### UI/UX & Professional Polish

* ‚ú® **Modern dApp Experience:** A custom dark theme, a professional header with a wallet "chip", and component-based code create a premium user experience.
* üîê **Two-Factor Verification:** Goes beyond AI assessment to provide verifiable proof by reading on-document QR codes and displaying the confirmed data on the UI.
* üëÄ **Live Workflow Visualizer:** A dynamic visualizer makes the complex backend process transparent and engaging.
* üñºÔ∏è **"My RWA Portfolio" & Staking Dashboard:** User-centric dashboards to view minted assets and manage staking, creating a complete portfolio experience.
* üìú **Interactive AI Report Card:** A polished "Report Card" component with a radial progress bar for the authenticity score.
* üîç **"Peek Behind the Curtain" Payload Viewer:** A modal for technical judges to view the raw JSON transaction payloads.
* üë®‚Äçüíª**Toast Notifications & Social Sharing:** Modern toast notifications provide smooth feedback, and a "Share on X" button encourages community engagement.

## üöÄ The A.R.I.A. Experience: A 60-Second Guide

When you use A.R.I.A. or watch our demo, you will see a complete journey:

1. **Instant AI & QR Verification:** An uploaded document is analyzed and cross-verified in seconds.
2. **One-Click Minting:** The verified data is used to mint a unique, on-chain RWA NFT.
3. **Seamless Listing & Sale:** The new NFT is immediately listed and can be sold on a decentralized marketplace.
4. **The Magic Moment:** We will show on the block explorer how a sale automatically triggers our **Splitter contract** to send a 5% fee directly to the **Staking contract**.
5. **Earn Real Yield:** We will then use the Staking Dashboard to stake `$ARIA` and show how users can earn a share of the platform's revenue.

-----

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the A.R.I.A. project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (`v18+`) & npm
* Python 3.8+ & pip
* Keplr Wallet Browser Extension

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd aOS_Aria
    ```

2. **Setup the Backend (AI Agent):**

    ```sh
    cd aria-backend
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Create a `.env` file in `aria-backend` and add your API keys:

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    PINATA_API_KEY="YOUR_PINATA_API_KEY"
    PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY="YOUR_PINATA_SECRET_KEY"
    ```

3. **Setup the Frontend:**

    ```sh
    cd ../aria-frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

You will need two separate terminal windows.

1. **Run the Backend Server:**

    ```sh
    cd aria-backend
    source venv/bin/activate
    python app.py
    ```

    The backend will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2. **Run the Frontend Development Server:**

    ```sh
    cd aria-frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## üîÆ Future Vision

With the core "Trust & Monetization Engine" now built, our post-hackathon roadmap is focused on scaling A.R.I.A. into the central hub for RWA liquidity on Andromeda:

* **Fractionalization:** Integrate CW20 ADOs to allow users to fractionalize high-value RWAs into fungible tokens.
* **DeFi Collateralization:** Partner with lending protocols to allow A.R.I.A.'s AI-verified NFTs to be used as trusted collateral for loans.
* **Expanding AI Capabilities:** Integrate more advanced AI models for active fraud detection, predictive valuation, and automated compliance checks.
